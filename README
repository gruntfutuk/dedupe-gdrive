changes file name of duplicate files in each GDRIVE folder to extend with unique id
so that the GDRIVE can be backed up with solutions that cannot cope with
with more than one file with same name in any folder

dedupe is a misnomer as you still have duplicate files, just with different filenames

however, as the programme doesn't do anything to actually compare files beyond
checking the file names then this is safest as you might be using GDRIVE to hold
different versions or indeed completely different thigns that just happen to have
the same file name

## json file required
note that the programme requires a GDRIVE API JSON file client_secrets.json in the
same folder as the programme to provide the secrets required for Google Authentication
and in addition on invocation, a web page will be opened for selection and completion
of the correct google account authentication

## running
python gdriverenamev1.0.py  # or whatever the current file name is
python3 gdriverenamev1.0.py # if your default python is python2.x
